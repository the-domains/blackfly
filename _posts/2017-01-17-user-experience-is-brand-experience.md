  The phrase, "we're concerned about our brand," is often misused. These words
  commonly mask a group's real desire, which is focused on visuals. Translated
  to its intended meaning, this phrase might read, "make our logo bigger, and
  use more of our corporate color." I might sound glib, but many would attest to
  the accuracy of this comment.
