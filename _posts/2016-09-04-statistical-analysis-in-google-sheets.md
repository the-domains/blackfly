Google Sheets is getting better and better every day. Checkout this new statistics [add-on][0]

<article style=""><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/efe556dc9e326ddfe6ffb1b0ce22ade8e15ef82e.png" /><h1>Statistical analysis in Google Sheets</h1><p>I'm happy to announce a new " Statistics" add-on for Google Sheets (the spreadsheet component of Google docs). The add-on provides statistics and data analysis functionality right in Google Sheets, so you don't need to download your data to a separate customized statistics application.</p></article>
